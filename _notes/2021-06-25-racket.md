hello there üëãüèΩ glad you‚Äôre curious about making a racket together. my primary purpose is to use audio as a medium to transform the cold email/DM into a warm hello! and i would love for the world to hear about your passions and what makes you feel like a little child again. 

the conversation is recorded & saved forever like the ol' photo albums of yore. a reminder that connecting with strangers can be an experience to cherish and build on till we‚Äôre no longer strangers, but playmates.

## how do we play?

post the initial ‚Äòhello, can you hear me‚Äôs and ‚Äòhey, how are you‚Äôs, we can slide into a cool, casual, and candid conversation. i like to start with a question and riff about it but this isn‚Äôt a one-sided interview. 

if you pause, i‚Äôll jump in. if i pause, you can dive in. kinda like playing hot potato. i believe in attraction rather than promotion, so let people know where they can reach you online to continue the conversation. 

remember, there are no edits so you‚Äôll have a link ready to share minutes after we end the session.if you still have any questions, or concerns, please reach out [via email](mailto:reddy2go@hey.com) or [twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/reddy2go).
