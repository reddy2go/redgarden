we’re born to play together, with infinite possibilities in the quest to reach our maximum potential in this multiplayer game of life.

i envision a world in which play, not study or work is the default. you might say i’m on a mission to make playtime a part of every adult’s life, but that’s on you!

> the real **secret of life**: to be completely engaged with what you're doing in the here and now, and instead of calling it work, realize that this **is play** - Alan Watts

## who am i?

the usefulness of the bowl is in the emptiness. so in the emptiness of a life without profession and purpose, shines my light of play, in the moment.

this is me, playing with thoughts, words and actions to find delight in uncertainty and having the time of my life!

more of a [burning dervish](/who-the-fuck-is-reddy/), than a guiding light in the darkness, i’m here not to show you the way, but to infect you with the spirit of play. and if you're game, jump right in...
