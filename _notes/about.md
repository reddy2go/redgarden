we’re born to play together, with infinite possibilities in the quest to reach our maximum potential in this multiplayer game of life.

envision a world in which play, not study or work is the default. you might say i’m on a mission to make playtime a part of every adult’s life, but that’s on you!

> the real **secret of life**: to be completely engaged with what you're doing in the here and now, and instead of calling it work, realize that this **is play** - Alan Watts

### who am i?
the usefulness of the bowl is in the emptiness. so in the emptiness of a life without profession and purpose, shines my light of play, in the moment.

if you're wondering [[who the fuck is Reddy?]],this is me, playing with thoughts, words and actions to find delight in uncertainty and having the time of my life! more of a burning dervish than a guiding light in the darkness, i’m here not to show you the way, but to infect you with the spirit of play. and if you're game, join the [[playpals]]!
