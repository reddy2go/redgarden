a while ago [[Eyal Shay]] expressed his desire to rap freestyle, and a little later [[Niko]] just dove straight in and has been spitting fire ever since.

### why bother?
having no fascination for the genre growing up, i've always been averse yet amused to the world fawning over rap. despite that my admiration for the artists has grown because it appeals to the primal and spontaneous expression similar to [[Zen koans]] and [[Freudian slips]]. 

### how's this gonna play out?
that answered the why. as for the how, i'm starting to document my deep play into freestyle rapping, by writing the songs that drive me. maybe my friends will sing them or maybe i will, but they will find a way out to become a Munchesque shout!

if you wanna follow me down the rabbit hole, choose your own adventure and tag along, maybe you'll hear a bloodied song.

[[what do i want to rap about]]
[[navarasa]] or the nine emotions
