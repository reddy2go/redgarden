everytime i scratch that itch<br/>
that primal urge to yell and bitch<br/>
making space to share my thoughts<br/>
look closer to find just scary warts

the world may read through and balk<br/>
couldn't care if you scoff or mock <br/>
there is a sense within that sighs<br/>
as i write, towards the skies it flies

they call this space a digital garden<br/>
but out here there be no guarding<br/>
everything i write is a profound penis<br/>
a snapshot of my raging hard hubris

if you're here admiring this textuality<br/>
stay awhile, and you will find divinity<br/>
we're all here to connect & copulate<br/>
scream, shout, express and ejaculate
