everyone has to start somewhere, be it square one or [[rock-bottom]]. this space is messy, confusing and you might wonder why, or just turn around and fly.

if you choose to stay, know that it's a feature not a bug. there might be more structure someday that will guide you along maps of content. for now, here are...

### some springboards
- [[learn to live or live to earn]]
- [[what's my game]]
- [[rock-bottom]]
- [[learn to play]]
- [[origin story of play]]
- [[freestyle rapping]]

or browse the visual graph (map of context) that you find on the [home page](/).
