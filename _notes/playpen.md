> joy is our default state of mind. period. and play is the way to get there. but we have forgotten how to enjoy without reason, like children can.

that’s why we are creating this kindergarten community for adults. to get you started we're launching an email based course shortly. sign up or visit back to check for the launch date.

### [enter the playpen on Luma](https://lu.ma/community/com-bTQQ4bGoEThBj51)
[### why 9 days?
- cats have 9 lives soo... yeah, you get it. i’m just winging it here. there’s no method to my madness and i’m just here to have fun. together.
- nothing here is backed by research papers and institutional curriculum, everything here is designed in the spirit of my dozen plus cats.
- i’m their guinea pig and they’ve decided if it’s good enough for me, it’s good enough for you. not that they care too much for either of us.

### got no time to play


## show me the money

i’m not a shy guy or hesitant to take your money. also there’s nothing in here that isn’t worth it’s weight in gold, but i’d rather take crypto (it’s lighter).

money is modern man’s replacement for blood. ‘_put your money where your mouth is_’ is a rather tame replacement for ‘_who will march with me, who will die with me?_’ but i’ll take it.

ok. ok. i’ll get to it.

-   **90$** (9$ monthly) gets you a weekly newsletter with a bunch of actionable playful prompts and games. and access to the discord community.
-   **120$** gets you access to a 9 day cohort based course where we take a guided journey into childhood and back to find that magic mojo you lost. also access to the discord community.
-   **900$** gets you access to every monthly cohort to play with old and new playmates. and access to the discord community. and the weekly newsletter. and a price lock-in for the entire year.

## any other options?

if you don’t have the moolah, there’s no need for a sense of inadequacy. the most important asset in the playground is playful playmates. so you can apply for a scholarship seat, which will be paid for from the others who bought in. which means for every 18 member cohort that sells out, we’ll offer 9 free seats. of course, you maybe pushed to the next cohorts as we’re capping cohorts at 18 members max.

## alpha cohort kickoff party!](<# be a playpal

## take a walk on the fun side!

find your fun. enjoy your day, not just endure it. life's a trip, so let's jump on the funwagon and create memories together with other play pals.

but you're at a standstill and life seems like a chore instead of an adventure

you feel the gravity of life weighing you down, and you're missing the levity of play you enjoyed as a child.

our lives revolve around work and even if you enjoy what you do, feel like it's your purpose in life...

don't you wonder if there is more to life than work?

play offers a gateway to the infinite through the magic of the moment, beyond a life of mere meaning and purpose.

as playpals, we won't pretend to help you find the answer. actually, we'll leave you with more questions to play with. you'll learn to play with probability instead of work for certainty.

![processs-1024x576.png](http://metasprint.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/processs-1024x576.png)

you will create an environment of serendipity where playmates will join you, and help you devise your own playbooks for a life of adventure. 

you will learn to play with uncertainty and change as you navigate time and space as an adult in this strange and dangerous world.

this trip is what you need to breeze through your mid life crisis, not a sports car or a hot affair!

get on the bus before you're ready, because you'll never be and that's perfecto 🤌🏽

%3E playpals is an online road trip for people who are looking for that spring in their step they once had as a child 🥳
