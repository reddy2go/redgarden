> joy is our default state of mind. period. and play is the way to get there. but we have forgotten how to enjoy without reason, like children can.

## take a walk on the fun side!
find your fun. enjoy your day, not just endure it. life's a trip, so let's jump on the fun-wagon and create memories together with other play pals.

### you know you want to
but you're at a standstill and life seems like a chore instead of an adventure

you feel the gravity of life weighing you down, and you're missing the levity of play you enjoyed as a child.

### if only you didn't have to work...
our lives revolve around work and even if you enjoy what you do, feel like it's your purpose in life...

don't you wonder if there is more to life than work?

play offers a gateway to the infinite through the magic of the moment, beyond a life of mere meaning and purpose.

- you will create an environment of serendipity where playmates will join you, and help you devise your own playbooks for a life of adventure. 
- you will learn to play with uncertainty and change as you navigate time and space as an adult in this strange and dangerous world.
