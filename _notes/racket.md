hello there! glad you’re curious about making a racket together. my primary purpose is to use audio as a medium to transform the cold email/DM into a warm hello! and i would love for the world to hear about your passions and what makes you feel like a little child again.

the conversation is recorded & saved forever like ol' photo albums (audio selfie?) of yore. a reminder that connecting with strangers can be an experience to cherish and build on till we’re no longer strangers, but playmates.

### how do we play?
- post the initial ‘hello, can you hear me’s and ‘hey, how are you’s, we can slide into a cool, casual, and candid conversation. i like to start with a question and riff about it but this isn’t a one-sided interview.
- if you pause, i’ll jump in. if i pause, you can dive in. kinda like playing hot potato. i believe in attraction rather than promotion, so let people know where they can reach you online to continue the conversation.
- remember, there are no edits so you’ll have a link ready to share soon after we end the session. if you still have any questions, or concerns, please reach out [via email](mailto:reddy2go@hey.com) or [twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/reddy2go).
