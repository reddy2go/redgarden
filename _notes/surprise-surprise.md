you are probably wondering where i’d disappeared and angry about not being kept in the loop about my absence or my change in publishing cadence. i’m apologetic for that. 

what i’m not apologetic for is the actual hibernation from creation. because i believe the magic in my madness was fading and i want us both to be on the bleeding edge of insanity. i wanted to rekindle that fire 🔥 

there is a precipice where possibilities are piled up like rocks atop each other balancing precariously. on this edge i meditated upon the future of this adventure of play. what are we doing? where are we going? why are we playing?

## together forever?

why would we continue this adventure, one without destination or direction? why would we walk together? and for how long? whatever direction and destination we walk toward, whatever duration we walk together for, the commitment to each other is key.

so this issue will be the last i’ll be writing as a free letter. i’ll henceforth be writing a paid newsletter which will be daily posts like you’ve been used to. as well as a weekly curated letter of playful prompts, games, exercises and videos.

so we’re going to invest time, money and effort together in this relationship and if you want to commit up front, you’re welcome to sign up for the newsletter. you also have the choice of joining a cohort based course on play, starting soon and i’ll be opening access to a discord channel next week as well. let me know if you're interested or not.

## let's play!

just hit reply to this mail and type **'let's play!'** if you want to continue receiving mails from me (free or paid). if you don't reply, i'll assume you don't want to continue and will unsubscribe you. i'm using this opportunity to purge this email list before we jump on this new leg of our adventure. it's time for us both to commit to this game if we're going to take this to the next level. here's [more info](__GHOST_URL__/playpen) on what's in store ahead. hope to see you on the other side...

joy is our default state of mind. period. and play is the way to get there. butwe have forgotten how to enjoy without reason, like children can. that’s why we are creating this kindergarten for adults. to get you startedhere’s a 9 day cohort based course across 3 phases - stop, rewind and play.y…
