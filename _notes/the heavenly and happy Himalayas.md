the mountains beckon to many but they've always just dragged me by the neck! if you wanna explore the peaks and valley of my mind, you're invited alongside for precisely random thoughts spewed with supreme skill and utter contempt for clarity. if you wanna walk along with lackadaisical devotion you couldn't ask for a wilder  playmate to fuel that fervour.
